# XNAP-Painting Processing 
In this project we are working with a set of images representing paintings and we have some information related to this artisitic works. There are many goals we can try to achieve, such as detecting the painter or the sytle, we can even predit two characteristics at the same time. 

We are based on a starting point, which works with Keras.

## Week 1
### Target goals
- Detect the painter of the painting.
- Try two more different optimizers (RMSProp, SGD) and compare their accuracy.
- Do some Data Augmentation and see if the accuracy improves.

### Planning
We divided our target goals in 4 mini-goals so each one of us could improve one:
- Data Augmentation (Image flip) -> Ariadna Lucero
- Data Augmentation (Image Rotation) -> Daria 
- Optimizer (RMSProp) -> Marta Monsó
- Optimizer (SGD) -> Marcè De la Torre

### Results
