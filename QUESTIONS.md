# XNAP-Painting Processing 
Write here a short summary about your project. The text must include a short introduction and the targeted goals

## Week 1
### Target goals
- Detect the painter of the painting 
- Try two more different optimizers (RMSProp , ?? ) and compare their accuracy
- Do some Data Augmentation and see if the accuracy improves

### Planning
We divided our target goals in 4 mini-goals so each one of us could improve one:
- Data Augmentation (Image flip) -> Ariadna Lucero
- Data Augmentation (Image Rotation) -> Daria 
- Optimizer (RMSProp) -> Marta Monsó
- Optimizer (?) -> Marcè De la Torre

### Results
